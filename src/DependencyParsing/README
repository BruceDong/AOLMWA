1.Modify the mutation threshold (mp)

f(mp)=exp(-affinity)*mp;

Generating mp automatically

2.Modify mutation of receptors of word agents.

If the affinity is not zero, 

mutationIncreamence = exp(-affinity)*affinity;

and the ith bit in the receptor is increased as follows:

increamence(i) = (mutationIncreamence*2.0*i)/(nb*(nb + 1.0));

where nb is the number of bits in a receptor. And it subjects to that mutationIncreamence is the sum of increamence(i);
